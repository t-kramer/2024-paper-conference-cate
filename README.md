# Spatial Thermal Autonomy (sTA): CATE 2024 Conference Data and Code Repository

This repository contains all data and analysis code used for the paper titled *"Spatial Thermal Autonomy (sTA): A New Metric for Enhancing Building Design Towards Comfort, Heat Resilience, and Energy Autonomy,"* presented at the CATE 2024 conference in Seville.

To replicate the analysis, you can go through the [notebook](data-analysis.ipynb) and run all cells. All required data is stored in the [data folder](data). The figures will be exported to `export/img`. To run the code, you might have to install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. You can do that by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


In case of any questions or issues, feel free to [reach out](mailto:t.kramer@berkeley.edu).
